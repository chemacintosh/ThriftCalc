# ThriftCalc
Server hosting a calculator with the code for both: server and client.
The coding isn't the best, this is only a little bit of me playing with thrift to understand
how it works and how it can be used nowadays.

__HOW TO USE IT?__
->Open 2 terminal tabs and move inside this folder 
->Being in the folder:
  Run servidor.py in one terminal
  Run cliente.py in the other one and you can now start to calculate some basic operations
